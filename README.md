Final Project for DevMountain/Gift for Boss
#This will contain all the steps that I plan to implement for the project
##While it will have later steps listed, they will not be pushed for security reasons.

##Section 1: Build the Consumer side of the site// Hitting about 90% Completion.  I need to gather info for hours and address info to finish up. Caveat: I would like to add some deal info on all three pages that is modifiable through the admin log in.  Can't complete that till I am finished with the login for admins.
*Scaffold site

*Add Proper Divs and areas to fill out the main and secondary pages

*Add in links to make everything work.

*Make it Pretty

*Ask for input from Store Owner, Store Manager, friends, and family

##Section 2: Add a login server and email server
*Allow access to only a couple people so they can modify the site at will

*Add the ability to receive and send emails to consumers

*Ask for input from Store Owner, Store Manager, and Mentors

##Section 3: Expand the employee backend
*Allow access to the rest of employee's via username and password

*Add the ability to create Schedules for employees for as many weeks as desired (start with one->make it pretty->add the ability for more)

*Only allow modifications for admin accounts

*Ask for input from Store Owner, Store Manager, and Mentors

##Section 4: Expand the Consumer Front-End and Employee Back-End for other locations and Franchise Owners
*Split up email servers for each Franchise owners if requested (need to ask first)

*Split up employee backend according to location and Franchise owner

*Ask for input

##After every section test and make sure no errors are found
###The Site should be upload-able after Section 1
